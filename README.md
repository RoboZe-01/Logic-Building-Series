# Logic Building series Overall Plan ( You can also follow this to build a strong logic ) 

## 🧠 Your Goals:

* Build a **strong problem-solving mindset** using Python.
* Master **control flow**, **data structures**, and **DSA**.
* Learn to **solve real-world problems** using scripting and automation.
* Get comfortable enough to create **AI/ML/data science projects**.
* Ultimately, have the logic and ability to build smart, scalable apps.

---

## 📆 Plan Structure:

* **Daily Time:** 1 hour
* **Problem Structure (Daily):**

  * ✅ 1 Conceptual DSA Problem (focus on structure/algorithms)
  * ✅ 1 Python Logic Problem (focus on implementation)
  * ✅ 1 Mini Scripting/Automation challenge every 2-3 days
* **Weekly Review:** Once every 7 days, revise and build a mini project

---

## 🗂️ Phase-Wise Plan:

---

### 🔰 **Phase 1: Python Fundamentals + Control Flow + Data Types (Day 1–10)**

> Goal: Be comfortable with variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and all core Python data types.

#### Concepts:

* `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
* `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`
* `if`, `elif`, `else`
* `for`, `while` loops
* `range()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`
* `functions`, `return`, `scope`
* `input()` and `type casting`

#### Practice Mix:

* 2 DSA Problems daily:

  * Pattern printing
  * List & dict manipulation
  * Basic function problems
* 1 Logic-based mini challenge:

  * FizzBuzz, Palindrome checker, Prime number counter
* 1 automation problem every 3rd day:

  * e.g., Auto rename files in folder

---

### 🧠 **Phase 2: Intermediate Python + Core DSA (Day 11–25)**

> Goal: Use DSA with Python effectively. Think in steps. Learn to break down problems.

#### Concepts:

* Recursion, sorting techniques
* Searching (linear, binary)
* Arrays/Lists (sliding window, prefix sum)
* Hashing (dict, set)
* Functions + recursion

#### Practice Mix:

* 1 DSA problem:

  * Searching/sorting/recursion
* 1 Python problem:

  * String/number manipulation, list comprehension
* 1 scripting idea every 3 days:

  * Automate Excel reader, rename files, web scraping basics

---

### 🧮 **Phase 3: Data Structures in Depth (Day 26–40)**

> Goal: Build deeper intuition for problem-solving with real structures.

#### Concepts:

* Stack, Queue, Linked List
* Sliding Window, Two Pointers
* HashMaps
* Custom functions for logic building

#### Practice Mix:

* 2 DSA problems per day

  * Focus: Use built-in & custom data structures
* 1 scripting logic

  * e.g., Create a to-do list, CLI app with files
* Weekly mini challenge:

  * Create a productivity tracker using Python file IO

---

### 🤖 **Phase 4: Automation & Problem-Solving with Scripting (Day 41–50)**

> Goal: Solve daily-life or business problems using Python logic

#### Concepts:

* File automation
* Reading/writing PDFs, CSVs
* Working with APIs
* Regex basics

#### Practice Mix:

* 1 scripting problem daily:

  * e.g., automate file conversion
* 1 DSA/logic problem

  * e.g., use Queue for task manager
* Weekly mini project:

  * Create a "daily goal tracker" CLI app

---

### 🧠 **Phase 5: AI/ML/DS Foundations + Smart Automation (Day 51–60)**

> Goal: Start thinking like an AI/ML engineer — problem solver with Python power.

#### Concepts:

* Intro to NumPy, pandas
* Regex, APIs, Web scraping
* Automating repetitive AI workflows
* Create your own problem-solving utilities

#### Practice Mix:

* Daily smart script idea:

  * e.g., scrape data, analyze using pandas
* 1 automation + logic challenge

  * e.g., make a script that reads .txt and summarizes it
* Final Project:

  * Build a Python-based mini AI productivity tool or utility

## 📌 Key Tips for Your 60-Day Journey

### ✅ **Tips**

1. **Use print often**: Trace what’s happening step by step.
2. **Break big problems** into tiny steps.
3. **Read others' code**: See how others think.
4. **Debug actively**: Don’t fear errors – they’re learning points.
5. **Build habits**: Same time each day builds mental momentum.
6. **Write pseudo-code** before actual code.

### 💪 **Pro Tips**

* Create a **Notion dashboard or Trello board** to track concepts.
* Maintain a **"Problem-Solving Journal"** (digital/physical) to write learnings.
* Do **code-alongs on YouTube** when stuck.
* Learn with intent — **understand the “why” before the “how.”**

---

## ✅ How You’ll Use This Plan Daily:

**Daily Workflow (1 Hour):**

1. Spend 10 mins reviewing yesterday’s concepts
2. Solve 2 DSA/logic problems (40 mins)
3. Solve or plan an automation/script (10 mins)
4. Reflect and note down learning (5 mins)

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Duration:** 60 Days, 1 hour daily
* **Focus:** Python mastery + logic building + DSA + scripting
* **Phase-wise path:** From basics → structures → automation → AI scripting
* **Approach:** Problem-solving first, not just learning syntax

## Hard Problem 
#Python Script Challenge: ATM Simulation


# Problem:

# Initial balance = ₹5000

# Ask the user to enter the amount to withdraw

# If amount > balance → print "Insufficient funds"

# Else → deduct amount and show remaining balance

# Allow multiple transactions (use a loop)

# Exit when user enters "exit" or balance becomes 0

    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop lets you **iterate** (loop) over a **sequence** like a list, tuple, string, range, or even a custom object. It is used when you **know beforehand** how many times you want to iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🔎 2. Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",

    "### 🔹 Example 1: Loop through numbers\n",
